# WebApplication2

The project includes various ASP.NET Web Forms pages, such as dodaj_projekt.aspx (add project), dodaj_rodzaj.aspx (add type), and dodaj_status.aspx (add status), among others. These pages suggest functionalities for adding and editing projects, types, and statuses within the application. The presence of a Site1.Master file indicates the use of a master page for consistent layout across the application. Additionally, the App_Data folder is typically used in ASP.NET applications to store database files, implying that the application manages data storage internally.
